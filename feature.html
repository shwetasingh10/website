</section>
<section class="pt1">

<h1>iPhone Buttons and Controls</h1>
<p>Though the iPhone’s coolest control features are based around the multi-touch screen, it also has a number of buttons on its face that are used for control.</p>
</section>
<section class="ctrl">

		<div class="btn">
		<ul>
			<li><b>Side button:</b> At the side of the iPhone (or at the top right corner on older models), you’ll find the Side button. Pressing this button locks the screen and/or puts the phone to sleep. It’s also the button used to restart the phone.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

		<div class="btn">
		<ul>
			<li><b>Volume buttons:</b> On the left side of the phone, buttons that move up and down control the volume of music, video, and the phone’s ringer.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

		<div class="btn">
		<ul>
			<li><b>Ringer button:</b> Just above the volume control is a smaller rectangular button. This is the ringer button, which allows you to put the phone into silent mode so the ringer won’t sound when calls come in.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
		<div class="btn">
		<ul>
			<li><b>Lightning Port:</b> This port, at the bottom of the phone, is where you plug in the cable to sync the phone with a computer, as well as accessories.</li>
		</ul>
